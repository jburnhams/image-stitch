# Repository guidelines

- All production source lives in `src/`.
- All test code lives in `tests/` and is split into:
  - `tests/unit` for fast, isolated tests (used for coverage).
  - `tests/integration` for slow/external-resource tests.
  - `tests/utils` for shared fixtures and helpers (including scripts and static assets).
- Unit tests are executed via `npm run test:unit` and power coverage via `npm run coverage`.
- Integration tests run via `npm run test:integration` and require the browser bundles generated by `npm run build:docs`.
