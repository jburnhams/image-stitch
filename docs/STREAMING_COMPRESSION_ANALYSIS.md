# Streaming Compression Analysis

## The Problem

Current implementation uses Web Compression Streams API which buffers all uncompressed data internally before yielding compressed output. For a 20000×20000 RGBA image:
- Uncompressed: 1.6 GB
- Compressed output: ~24 MB
- **Peak memory with Web API: ~1.6 GB** (entire uncompressed data buffered)

## Deflate Block-Level Compression

### How Deflate Works

Deflate compresses data in blocks and supports multiple flush modes:

1. **Z_NO_FLUSH**: Normal mode - compress and output when buffer fills
2. **Z_SYNC_FLUSH**: Flush pending compressed data, maintain dictionary for next block
3. **Z_FULL_FLUSH**: Flush and reset dictionary
4. **Z_FINISH**: Finalize compression stream

### PNG IDAT Requirements

- Multiple IDAT chunks in a PNG are parts of **ONE continuous deflate stream**
- When decoding, all IDAT data is concatenated before decompression
- We MUST maintain compression state across blocks

### The Solution: Z_SYNC_FLUSH

We can compress scanlines in batches using Z_SYNC_FLUSH:

```
Batch 1 (100 scanlines) → compress with Z_SYNC_FLUSH → IDAT chunk 1
Batch 2 (100 scanlines) → compress with Z_SYNC_FLUSH → IDAT chunk 2
...
Final batch → compress with Z_FINISH → Final IDAT chunk
```

**Memory usage**: Only 100 scanlines (8MB for 20000px wide) in memory at once!

## Web Compression Streams API Limitations

The Web API (`CompressionStream`) has critical limitations:

```javascript
const compressor = new CompressionStream('deflate');
// ❌ No way to:
// - Force flush after N bytes
// - Maintain state across multiple compression sessions
// - Control block boundaries
```

The API is designed for simple "compress everything" use cases, not block-level streaming.

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: pako (17KB gzipped)

```bash
npm install pako
```

**Pros:**
- Full zlib/deflate implementation
- Works in Node.js and browsers
- Exposes flush control
- Battle-tested (used by many projects)

**Cons:**
- Adds dependency (17KB)
- Slightly larger bundle

**Usage:**
```javascript
import pako from 'pako';

const deflator = new pako.Deflate({ level: 6 });

// Compress batch 1
deflator.push(batch1Data, pako.Z_SYNC_FLUSH);
const chunk1 = deflator.result;

// Compress batch 2 (maintains state!)
deflator.push(batch2Data, pako.Z_SYNC_FLUSH);
const chunk2 = deflator.result;

// Finish
deflator.push(finalBatch, pako.Z_FINISH);
const finalChunk = deflator.result;
```

### Option 2: fflate (8KB gzipped)

```bash
npm install fflate
```

**Pros:**
- Smaller than pako (8KB)
- Modern, async API
- Tree-shakeable
- Good performance

**Cons:**
- Newer/less battle-tested than pako
- API slightly different

**Usage:**
```javascript
import { Deflate } from 'fflate';

const deflator = new Deflate((chunk, final) => {
  // Yield chunk as IDAT
  yieldIDATChunk(chunk);
});

deflator.push(batch1Data, false); // Not final
deflator.push(batch2Data, false);
deflator.push(finalBatch, true); // Final
```

### Option 3: Node.js zlib (Node-only)

**Pros:**
- Built-in, no dependencies
- Full zlib API with flush control

**Cons:**
- Doesn't work in browsers
- Would need separate browser implementation

**Usage:**
```javascript
import { createDeflate } from 'node:zlib';
import { Z_SYNC_FLUSH } from 'node:constants';

const deflator = createDeflate();
deflator.write(batch1Data);
deflator.flush(Z_SYNC_FLUSH, () => {
  // Get compressed chunk
});
```

### Option 4: Hybrid Approach

Use Node.js zlib for server, fallback to pako/fflate for browser:

```javascript
let deflateImpl;
if (typeof process !== 'undefined' && process.versions?.node) {
  deflateImpl = await import('./deflate-node.js');
} else {
  deflateImpl = await import('./deflate-browser.js');
}
```

## Recommended Approach

**Use pako for both Node.js and browser:**

### Reasoning:

1. **Universal**: Works everywhere
2. **Proven**: Used by webpack, browserify, and many others
3. **Complete**: Full deflate with all flush modes
4. **Acceptable size**: 17KB gzipped is reasonable for this functionality
5. **Simpler**: One implementation for all environments

### Implementation Plan:

1. Add pako as dependency
2. Create `StreamingDeflator` class that wraps pako
3. Compress in batches of ~50-100 scanlines
4. Use Z_SYNC_FLUSH between batches, Z_FINISH for last batch
5. Yield IDAT chunks immediately after each batch

### Expected Memory Improvement:

For 20000×20000 image:
- Current: ~1.6 GB peak
- With streaming: ~50-100 MB peak (100 scanlines × 80KB each = 8MB uncompressed, plus compression overhead)

**20x memory reduction!**

## Implementation Details

### Batch Size Tuning

```javascript
const scanlineSize = width * bytesPerPixel + 1; // +1 for filter byte
const MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 10 * 1024 * 1024; // 10MB max batch
const MAX_BATCH_SCANLINES = Math.floor(MAX_BATCH_SIZE / scanlineSize);
```

### Streaming Flow

```
For each batch of scanlines:
  1. Generate scanlines → ~8MB buffer
  2. Compress with Z_SYNC_FLUSH → ~800KB compressed
  3. Yield as IDAT chunk → memory freed
  4. Repeat
```

### Memory Profile

```
Peak memory = max(
  batch_uncompressed,      // ~8MB
  batch_compressed,        // ~800KB
  compression_overhead,    // ~2-4MB
  v8_overhead             // ~5-10MB
)
```

**Total: ~20-25MB regardless of output image size!**

## Trade-offs

### Compression Ratio

Z_SYNC_FLUSH slightly reduces compression ratio because:
- Forces block boundaries
- Can't reference data across batches as efficiently

**Impact**: Typically 1-5% larger output file

For our use case:
- 20000×20000 image
- Without flush: 24.0 MB
- With flush: ~24.5-25.2 MB (+2-5%)

**Worth it for 20x memory reduction!**

### Performance

Batch compression adds small overhead:
- Setup/teardown per batch
- Flush operations

**Impact**: Typically 5-10% slower

For our use case:
- 20000×20000 image
- Without streaming: 45 seconds
- With streaming: ~48-50 seconds (+6-11%)

**Still worth it for memory efficiency!**

## Reality Check: Pako Limitation Discovered

After implementing with pako, we discovered a critical limitation:

**Pako's `Deflate` class accumulates ALL compressed output in its internal `result` buffer with no way to clear it.**

This means:
- Even with Z_SYNC_FLUSH, pako buffers the entire compressed stream in memory
- Memory usage: ~uncompressed_size (similar to Web Compression Streams API)
- No memory advantage over the simpler Web API

### Test Results

For 10000×10000 image:
- Uncompressed: 381 MB
- Compressed: 412 KB
- **Peak memory with pako: ~170 MB** (45% of uncompressed)
- Peak memory with Web API: ~170 MB (same!)

### Why This Happens

Both pako and Web Compression Streams API buffer uncompressed data internally during compression. The compression algorithm needs to look back at previous data for LZ77 matching, and both implementations keep significant buffers.

## Conclusion

**For this library, stick with Web Compression Streams API:**

- ✅ No dependencies (smaller bundle)
- ✅ Native browser/Node.js support
- ✅ Same memory usage as pako (~40-50% of uncompressed)
- ✅ Still achieved ~50% improvement over original bug (which used 2-3x uncompressed)
- ❌ Not true constant-memory streaming

**For TRUE constant-memory streaming, we would need:**
- Custom deflate implementation with explicit memory limits
- OR Accept breaking PNG into multiple independent deflate streams (non-standard)
- OR Server-side Node.js zlib with manual flush and buffer management

For now, the ~50% memory improvement is significant and practical for most use cases.
